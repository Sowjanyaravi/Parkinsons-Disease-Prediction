ðŸ§  Parkinson's Disease Prediction using Machine Learning  

This repository contains the implementation of **PD-Net**, a Transformer-based deep learning model designed for early and accurate detection of **Parkinson's Disease (PD)**. The model leverages **multi-head attention mechanisms** and **time-series analysis** on speech, gait, and motor function recordings to identify patterns crucial for diagnosis.  

ðŸš€ Features  
- Transformer-based architecture** for sequence data processing  
- Multi-head attention** for improved pattern recognition  
- 96% accuracy**, outperforming SCNN and TLCNN models  
- Cross-validation & AUC-ROC analysis** for robust performance  

ðŸ“‚ Contents  
- Model implementation (Python)  
- Preprocessing & feature extraction scripts  
- Performance comparison & evaluation metrics  

ðŸ”¬ *Future work*: Integration with real-world clinical applications for enhanced early detection.
